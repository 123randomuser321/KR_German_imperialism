### German Imperialism in specific tags
### BAT
german_BAT:0 "Matters of [BAT.GetNameDef]"
german_BAT_desc:0 "Our subjects require constant attention and supervision. Even the domain of Adolf Friedrich, the most German of our subjects, is no exception."
german_BAT_subject:0 "[BAT.GetNameDef] in the German realm"
german_BAT_subject_desc:0 "Being the Ostwall of Germany, we have certain obligations towards the security of Mitteleuropa."
### BEL
german_BEL:0 "Matters of [BEL.GetNameDef]"
german_BEL_desc:0 "Flanders-Wallonia is, without a doubt, a delicate subject. While its creation was most certainly necessary, our western frontier is far from perfect."
german_BEL_subject:0 "[BEL.GetNameDef] in the German realm"
german_BEL_subject_desc:0 "Our relationship with the Germans is a peculiar one. We are, without a doubt, the Westwall of the German sphere. We are also, however, a battleground in itself."
### LIT
german_LIT:0 "Matters of [LIT.GetNameDef]"
german_LIT_desc:0 "Lithuania is a tough nut to crack. While we liberated them from Russian oppression, they are far from grateful and thus a pain to deal with."
german_LIT_subject:0 "[LIT.GetNameDef] in the German realm"
german_LIT_subject_desc:0 "We are [LIT.GetNameDef], reborn in the fires of the Weltkrieg after centuries of nonexistence. We are thankful to the Germans, sure, but they need to respect us."
### WHR
german_WHR:0 "Matters of [WHR.GetNameDef]"
german_WHR_desc:0 "Initially, White Ruthenia was a successful domain of ours. Sadly, the last few years have disappointed our collective expectations, thus requiring our attention."
german_WHR_subject:0 "[WHR.GetNameDef] in the German realm"
german_WHR_subject_desc:0 "[WHR.GetNameDef] is the odd child of the Ostwall. Carved out from the remnants of the Russian Empire, we never existed as a coherent state before. Now we must forge our identity, in Germany's shadow."
### MAF
german_MAF:0 "Matters of [MAF.GetNameDef]"
german_MAF_desc:0 "While it was no mistake to send more problematic members of society to Africa, this doesn't mean we should ignore the events in such a rich area."
german_MAF_subject:0 "[MAF.GetNameDef], home of Askaris and colonists"
german_MAF_subject_desc:0 "[MAF.GetName] is the powderkeg of Africa. While the government in [GER.Capital.GetName] can count on loyal Askaris and skillful administrators in the old colonies, other areas lack such structures. It is our job to fix this and achieve the dream of a true German Africa."
### MOR
german_MOR:0 "Matters of [MOR.GetNameDef]"
german_MOR_desc:0 "The... 'acquisition' of Morocco may be considered unnecessary by some individuals, and [MOR.GetNameDef] is certainly in a bothersome situation. One, however, cannot deny their potential use."
german_MOR_subject:0 "[MOR.GetNameDef] in the German realm"
german_MOR_subject_desc:0 "Some say dwelling in Germany's shadow is less than optimal. While true to a certain extent, we are kept on a long leash, which means, that, if done correctly, we can leverage the might of [GER.GetNameDef] to our gain."
### AOG
german_AOG:0 "Matters of [AOG.GetNameDef]"
german_AOG_desc:0 "As our primary source of income in East Asia and a useful way of leveraging [LEP.GetNameDef] against [QIE.GetNameDef], [AOG.GetNameDef] is more than worthy of our attention and resources."
german_AOG_subject:0 "[GER.GetNameDef] in China"
german_AOG_subject_desc:0 "§RTODO§!"
### GEA
german_GEA:0 "Matters of [GEA.GetNameDef]"
german_GEA_desc:0 "Though not formally a state on its own, [GEA.GetNameDef] is, out of necessity, run as such. While this takes a lot of weight of our shoulders, an occasional intervention may still be required, considering the less than ideal level of administration."
german_GEA_subject:0 "The [GEA.Capital.GetName] Administration"
german_GEA_subject_desc:0 "[GEA.GetName] has never formally been a state, just, as some would call it, \"a navy with a country attached\". This state of affairs might never change. We can, however, change the way our business is run."
