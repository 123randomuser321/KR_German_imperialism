gerimperialism.300.t:0 "The Fate of German Wallonia"
gerimperialism.300.d:0 "The Second Weltkrieg is over. And with it, our official reason for administering the Walloon industry is invalid.\nWhile it might be painful, we must finally decide what to do with this tract of land.\n\nDo we keep and integrate it, or do we return it to [BEL.GetName]?"
gerimperialism.300.a:0 "We have no need for this. Return the territory."
gerimperialism.300.ta:0 "This might ease tensions in the West."

gerimperialism.302.d:0 "The Grand Duchy of Luxemburg, part of [GER.GetNameDef] ever since the end of Weltkrieg, has, as of this afternoon, officially laid clame to the German-administered regions of Wallonia.\n\nWith this done, the Bundestag may decide further actions."

gerimperialism.303.a:0 "As expected."
gerimperialism.303.ta:0 "Germany now officially claims German Wallonia, and can use Luxemburg's claim as a justification."

### German is now mandatory second language
gerimperialism.304.t:0 "German - An official language"
gerimperialism.304.d:0 "German has been the official administrative language in German Wallonia ever since we occupied said territory.\nHowever, until now, the territory was considered an integral part of [BEL.GetNameDef], with us administering it until further notice.\n\nThis means that now, we must actually entrench German.\nWhile not an easy task, we can start by making German a mandatory second language in public schools, with us enforcing a strictly German-speaking administration on top of that."
gerimperialism.304.a:0 "Let's get to work, then."

### enforce German in all of academia
gerimperialism.305.t:0 "Further entrenchment of German"
gerimperialism.305.d:0 "With Germanisation coming along well, it might be time to tighten the noose on academia.\n\nWe will start to require all higher forms of academia, including essays and scientific works, to be written, read, taught, and generally handled in German."

### German entrenched in academia

### attracting GER and LUX settler
gerimperialism.307.t:0 "Settle German Wallonia"
gerimperialism.307.d:0 "We can not guarantee that the native Walloon population will stay loyal to us in the long run.\nThus it is required to establish a population that will stay loyal. The easiest way for us to achieve this, is by allowing Luxemburgian and German citizens in general to settle in our Walloon territories, preferably working for our nobility and companies."
gerimperialism.307.a:0 "A long endeavor, for sure."

### settlement complete
gerimperialism.308.t:0 "Settlement campaign concluded"
gerimperialism.308.d:0 "While an actual complete settlement of our Walloon territories is not technically feasible, we have established a loyal and more or less influential populus in Wallonia.\n\nThrough them, we can further exert our influence."
gerimperialism.308.a:0 "Patience is key."

### Charlotte gets the government
gerimperialism.309.t:0 "Partial transfer of authority"

### random industrial investments into 741
gerimperialism.311.t:0 "German Industrialists invest into German Wallonia"
gerimperialism.311.d:0 "It seems as though stating our intent to integrate our Walloon territories has led to an increase in investments into said area.\n\nToday, Krupp and other companies have opened a multitude of new factories."

### event to allow coring of 741
gerimperialism.312.t:0 "The State of affairs in German Wallonia"
gerimperialism.312.d:0 "Our efforts in aligning and integrating the Walloon territories are a success.\n\nGerman is taking root in all corners of the territory, the Grand Duchy successfully administeres its tracts of land and the population has been pacified.\n\nIt is time for the final step."
gerimperialism.312.a:0 "Let us finally put this issue to rest!"

### some flavor for final integration
gerimperialism.313.t:0 "Final integration begins."
gerimperialism.313.d:0 "The coming month will certainly be stressful, as there is still alot to do before we our goal is achieved.\n\nWhile we do have experience in organizing ceremonies, it will still take some time to actually plan one.\nAdditionally, we will still need to transfer full authority over the Walloon territories to the Grand Duchy of Luxemburg, including, but not limited to positioning garrisons, handing over economic control and staffing the administration with Luxemburgian officials.\n\nWe will, however, maintain a presence."
gerimperialism.313.a:0 "Let us get to work."

### finally get the core on 741 ### todo: beef this up a bit

gerimperialism.314.a:0 "Groß Luxemburg it is!"

### BEL loses core on 741
gerimperialism.315.t:0 "German Wallonia gone"
gerimperialism.315.d:0 "While technically not under our control for a long time, over the past months all signs of Walloon separatism in German-administered Wallonia have vanished.\nSad as it may be, it is lost."
gerimperialism.315.a:0 "A sadness overcomes me..."
