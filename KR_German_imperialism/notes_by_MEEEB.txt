General notes:

This mod gives the German Empire, as well as its subjects and allies, some form of interaction with the German sphere of influence.
That's the goal, at least.

As of now this mod does four things:

1. Subjects of the German Empire can request equipment from Germany, if they lack a certain type. (This, as of now, only works for players and not all types of equipment.)
2. Germany can now integrate and subsequently core German Wallonie (ID: 741) through a chain of decisions and events. ### THIS ONLY WORKS IF YOU ALLOW MAJOR NEWS EVENTS TO APPEAR
3. Germany can dampen its economic crash a bit by analyzing its subjects' economies and subsequently scamming them.
4. The Baltic Duchy can, as long as it's a a German puppet, raise Baltic German troops (as Freikorps).

Dev notes:

This still has a long way togo.

FYI: I will probably use this mod to learn certain things about modding HoI4, so if this turns into a shitfest:
You have been warned.
