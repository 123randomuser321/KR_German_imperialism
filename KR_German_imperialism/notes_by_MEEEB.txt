Hello reader!

This doc is quick rundown on sources plus some general dev notes.


Sources:

[sources of knowledge will not be quoted, yet]


General notes:

This mod gives the German Empire, as well as its subjects and allies, some form of interaction with the German sphere of influence.
That's the goal, at least.

This mod, as of now, does not really work.
Be patient.

Files added:

[will redo this once things settled down]


Dev notes:

This still has a long way togo.

FYI: I will probably use this mod to learn certin things about modding HoI4, so if this turns into a shitfest:
You have been warned.
